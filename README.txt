Hi, if you've downloaded these files thank you for looking at my github!

The folder called "Input to Ouput" contains a program that reads a bunch of grades from a text file called "Marks.txt". It will then create a new text final that will censor the first three letters of the student IDs and calculate their final mark.
The code for the program is provided!

The folder called "Monty Hall Simulator" contains a program that simulates the monty hall game. You can also calculate the win percentages and such. 

Finally, the last program is able to calculate the resistance of resistors based on the colors inputed. 

Please note that these codes were created by Darren Bahadoor and are shown for educational pruposes only!
